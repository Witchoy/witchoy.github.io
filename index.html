        <section id="about"><h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                I am a French student in software development, specialized in front-end and back-end development for the design 
                and implementation of software solutions according to business needs. <br>

                My studies include the main programming languages, web development, system and network administration, 
                database management, and project management. In my current specialization, "Réalisation d'applications : conception, 
                développement, validation", I am acquiring skills in the development and maintenance of complex applications, performing 
                automated testing, and ensuring continuous integration. These skills apply to various fields: web, mobile, finance, 
                healthcare, and game development.<br>

                But beyond that, actually, what I learn is to create solutions for others to solve problems and improve their work 
                lives. At the same time, I am deepening one of my biggest passions, video game development. <br>

                    <p>Torrington is a serious game developed by a team of three as 
                        part of a university project. The game aims to teach players 
                        about the process of selecting academic programs at a university. 
                        Built using Godot and C#, it integrates concepts from our management, 
                        law, and development courses, applying everything we learned 
                        throughout our years at uni.</p></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Witchoy/witchoy.github.io">This website</a>
                    <p>This personal website marks the beginning of my journey into web 
                        development. So far, I’ve built it using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                         but I hope to explore frameworks in the future. My goal is to integrate
                          React and Next.js to expand the site with additional pages, new features, 
                          and maybe even a few hidden surprises.</p></li>
